description: >
    The Skeleton Device binding represents the SK11 device produced by
    the Skeleton Corporation. The binding can also support compatible
    clones made by second source vendors.

# This binding inherits property characteristics from the generic
# spi-slave binding

inherits:
    -   id: spi-slave

properties:

# The compatible property is a reserved name. The type is always "string"
# and should not be repeated device binding.

            "skel,sk11" || "faux,fx11" , BASE("skel,sk11")
        description: FX11 is a clone of the original SK11 device

# The reg property is a reserved name. The type is always "int" and
# should not be repeated in a device binding. Constraints are defined
# only in the context of the parent node's address, size, and ranges
# cells. The description is inherited from the spi-slave binding.
