Device Tree Binding Format
--------------------------

Background
----------

DT bindings historically were written as text in prose format which
led to issues in usability of that source documentation. Some of
these issues include the need to programmatically process binding
source documentation to do DTS validation, perform mass updates to
format/style, and to generate publishable documentation in HTML or
PDF form.

Overview
--------

The DT binding format is based on the YAML text markup language.
Although there are many text markup options available, YAML
fulfills all requirements considered for a DT binding source format
which include:

1) Must be human readable
2) Must be easily translated to other data formats (XML, JSON, etc).
3) Must have sufficient tools and libraries to enable developers to
   build new tools for DT binding processing
4) Must have a complete spec to refer to syntax

YAML is documentated in the specification found at
http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html

The required YAML DT binding tag format and syntax are defined in
the following sections.

YAML DT Binding Syntax
----------------------

* Lines starting with "#" are comments and not part of the binding itself
* "%YAML 1.2" starts a file, indicating the version of YAML in use
* "---" starts a binding document
* "..." ends a binding document
* Multiple binding documents may exist in a single file
* Tabs are not permitted
* Scope is denoted by indentation of four spaces
* Key value pairs are denoted by "key: value"
* Sequences are denoted by "-"
* Scalar values may convert newlines to spaces and preserve blank
  lines for long description formatting using ">"
* Scalar values may escape all reserved characters and preserve
  newlines by using "|" to denote literal style

For additional information on YAML syntax, refer to the specification
at http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html

YAML DT Binding Format
----------------------

The DT binding format is based on the YAML Core schema defined in the
specification. The following YAML sequences and keys are supported in
the DT binding format:

[Note: [R] and [O] denote required and optional sequences/keys,respectively]

* [R] version: DT binding format version. Currently 1.

* [R] id: unique identifier in property form (e.g. skel-device)

* [R] title: title of the binding

* [R] maintainer: sequence of maintainers
      [R] name: name and email of maintainer or mailing list in RFC822
                form.

* [O] description: full description of the binding

* [O] inherits: sequence of inherited bindings
      [R] id: unique identifier of inherited binding

* [R] properties: sequence of properties
      [R] name: name of property surrounded in double quotes
      [R} category: category of property. One of "required",
                    "optional", or "deprecated".
      [R] type: type of property. One of "string", "int", "empty",
                "phandle", or "array".
      [O] constraint: constraint expression using C syntax
      [O] deprecated: C syntax expression of deprecated compatible
                      strings.
      [O] description: description of the property

* [O] notes: Any additional notes about properties in this binding.

* [O] example: sequence of examples:
      [R] dts: DT source of example usage. The example text must use
               literal style ("|") so that it retains indentation and
               newlines.
      [O] description: description of the example

Skeleton Binding
----------------

The skeleton.yaml binding found in the top of the DT binding tree
is the canonical example of syntax and format to use when writing
a DT binding document. It is maintained with the latest formatting
conventions, making it the best starting point when writing a new DT
binding.
