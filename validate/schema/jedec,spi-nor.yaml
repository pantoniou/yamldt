        May include a device-specific string consisting of the
        manufacturer and name of the chip. A list of supported chip
        names follows.
        Must also include "jedec,spi-nor" for any SPI NOR flash that can
        be identified by the JEDEC READ ID opcode (0x9F).

        Use the "fast read" opcode to read data from the chip instead
        of the usual "read" opcode. This opcode is not supported by
        all chips and support for it can not be detected at runtime.
        Refer to your chips' datasheet to check if this is supported
        by your chip.
